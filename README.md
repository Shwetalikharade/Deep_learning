ðŸ”§ Model Architecture
Input Layer: 28Ã—28 pixels flattened to 784 features

Hidden Layer 1: 256 neurons, ReLU activation

Hidden Layer 2: 128 neurons, ReLU activation

Output Layer: 10 neurons, Softmax activation (for digits 0â€“9)

Optimizer: SGD (learning_rate=0.01)
Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
Metrics: Accuracy

ðŸ“Š Results
Model is trained for 10 epochs with batch size 128

Final accuracy and loss are printed after training

Training and validation loss/accuracy curves are displayed

ðŸ–¼ Sample Output
